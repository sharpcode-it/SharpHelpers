## Contributing

Want to contribute? Great! Here are a few guidelines.

1. If you want to do a feature, post an issue about the feature first. Some features are intentionally left out, some features may already be in the works, or I may have some advice on how I think it should be done. I would feel bad if time was spent on some code that won't be used.
2. If you want to do a bug fix, it might not be a bad idea to post about it too. I've had the same bug fixed by multiple people at the same time before.
3. All code should have a unit test. If you make a feature, there should be significant tests around the feature. If you do a bug fix, there should be a test specific to that bug so it doesn't happen again.
4. Pull requests should have a single commit. If you have multiple commits, squash them into a single commit before requesting a pull.
5. Try and follow the code styling already in place.
